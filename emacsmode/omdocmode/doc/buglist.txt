OMDoc mode -- buglist.txt			September 2002.

A selection of bugs, issues and problems we know about and 
(for the most part) intend to fix.

Bugs and blemishes
------------------
- Errors sometimes halt functions in an inconsistent state
  (requiring killing the current buffer).
- Indentation code is recursive, which overflows the recursion stack
  on deeply nested constructs and multi-tag lines.
  (making indentation code mostly iterative may help).
- Indentation breaks on empty lines and sometimes on CDATA.
- some of the templates for insertion need to be fixed
- better font colors for dark background (and test)
- redo and extend the process part (for validation)
- cleanup

Portability issues
------------------
- Some code occasionally breaks in emacs version 21 
  (because of tighter type checking)
- Essential constructs don't work in emacs 19.
  However, WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY PLANNING TO MAINTAIN omdoc-mode.el
  FOR EMACS VERSIONS 19 OR OLDER.

Additional functionality wishlist
---------------------------------
- for each tag: generate list of possible attributes for that tag
- command to get rid of certain empty tags
- command to generate closing tags (up to one of the main tags)
- command to go to next element, previous element
- command to delete the next element
- bug-reporting mechanism

Other (coding and cosmetic) improvements
----------------------------------------
- add customization properly
- add groups for omdoc (main group) and subgroups for fonts, process etc.
- clean up the configuration variables etc.
- cleanup the utility code.

More distant future 
-------------------
Brilliant, innovative, spectacular, and daring ideas to be added later.
