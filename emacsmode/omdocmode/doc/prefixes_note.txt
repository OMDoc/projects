OMDoc mode -- prefixes_note.txt			September 2002.

This note contains the answer to a question for a clarification
of the choice of keybindings for the template insertion functions.
(Excerpted/edited from an e-mail exchange).

Question:

Answer:

Sure...
1. All prefixes start with C-c  (as per major-mode convention).

2. For the second key, I used a control character corresponding to
   the main section letter for the tag type, so
   C-c C-s for (document) Structure elements
   C-c C-m for Math elements  (unfortunately, emacs turns this into <RET>).
   C-c C-t for Theories elements
   C-c C-a for Auxiliary elements
   C-c C-p for Presentation elements
   C-c C-o for OpenMath elements, and
   C-c C-o for Dublin Core elements.

3. Finally, I tried to follow a similar strategy for the third keystroke
   (this one not a control character).
  - I used the first letter of the tag whenever possible.
  - In the case of a tie, I guessed which construct would be the more frequent
    one, and assigned the first letter to that tag, choosing a later character
    or another symbol for the other tags, trying to make some mnemonic
    connection when I could think of one. For example, C-c C-m# for <pattern>.

The choices are currently hardwired in the code (omdoc-templates.el).
