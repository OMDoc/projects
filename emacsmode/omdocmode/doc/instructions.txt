Instructions for setting up a major mode for editing .omdoc files.
==================================================================
pjj@cs.cmu.edu, 1 September 2002.

1) Make sure that the omdoc-mode.el file (and its subsidiaries) are on
   your emacs's load-path (e.g. in the site-lisp directory). 
   If you have unpacked this distribution into /<somepath>/omdocmode, this
   can be accomplished with the following line in your .emacs(.el) file:
      (nconc (list "/<somepath>/omdocmode/src") load-path)

2) Make sure tempo.el is on your path as well
   (For the latest emacs versions, this should already be the case).

3) If you want to load omdoc-mode automatically when editing .omdoc
   files, put the following lines in your .emacs (or .emacs.el) file:
    (autoload 'omdoc-mode "omdoc-mode" "omdoc" t)
    (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.omdoc$" . omdoc-mode) auto-mode-alist))

4) If you are planning to use an external validation engine to
   validate your OMDoc files (as XML), put something like the following in your
   .emacs file (assuming you do have rxp in your path).

     (add-hook 'omdoc-mode-hook
        (function (lambda () 
  	    (setq omdoc-validate-program "rxp")
	    (setq omdoc-validate-params "-VNxs"))))

   other possiblities are 

     (add-hook 'omdoc-mode-hook
        (function (lambda () 
	    (setq omdoc-validate-program "xmllint")
	    (setq omdoc-validate-params "--valid"))))

     (add-hook 'omdoc-mode-hook
         (function (lambda ()
	    (setq omdoc-validate-program "nsgmls")
	    (setq omdoc-validate-params "-vw xml"))))

5) If this is not already done by default, you need to turn on font-lock
   in your .emacs(.el) file. Here is how that looks in mine (including
   how to set the colors of some relevant typefaces, should you want
   to change them).
       (global-font-lock-mode t)
       (setq font-lock-maximum-decoration t)
       (add-hook 'font-lock-mode-hook
            '(lambda ()
               (set-face-foreground font-lock-comment-face "DarkGreen")
               (set-face-foreground font-lock-string-face  "Sienna")
               (set-face-foreground font-lock-type-face    "Magenta1")))

6) Byte-compilation of the .el files is at the user's discretion.
   (The uncompiled version will probably be fast enough).

Note: 
The mode requires tempo.el which should have been included with your
emacs distribution. If this is not the case, you can download it from
ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/emacs/tempo.el.
