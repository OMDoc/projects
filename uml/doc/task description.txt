The aim of this project is a basic integration of \uml into \omdoc. To achieve this two main tasks
have to be completed: 

\section{Specification of an \omdoc/\uml module}
An \xml schema needs to be written that comprises all \uml diagram types currently supported in
\argouml, which are Class Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, Use Case Diagrams, Collaboration Diagrams,
State Diagrams and Deployment Diagrams. Furthermore all possibilities of interleaving these \uml
elements with native \omdoc elements need to be specified. More concretely: \uml diagrams may be
part of \omdoc theories and certain \omdoc objects, e.g. in \mathml formalized constraints, may be
part of \uml diagrams. The \xml schema will be written in the \rng schema language based on the
\dtd provided with \argouml, which in turn is based on the \xmischema production from the \uml
metamodel specified in \mof. Dependencies between \uml elements that are not inherent in the \xml
structure need to be documented and may be subject to future modifications of the \xml schema.

\section{Presentation of \omdoc/\uml documents}
An \xslt needs to be written that converts \xml documents adhering to the \xml schema written in
the first task to \xhtml. Most importantly the presentation layer of the \uml diagrams in \argouml
given in \pgml needs to be converted to \svg diagrams that can be embedded in \xhtml.
