Platforms:      Requires Mathematica version 4.2 or higher. 
                Should be OS independent. 

Copying-Policy: The package may be freely redistributed for noncommercial 
                purposes provided that no changes are made and that this 
                notice is included.

Keywords:       Mathematica notebooks, OpenMath, OMDoc.

WARNING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an experimental version containing only the rudiments of 
the conversion procedure.  It is distributed at this point mostly 
with a view towards getting early feedback.  The conversion works 
well for simple source notebooks, but no claim of completeness is 
made.  Most notably, the present version ignores output and graphics. 
An experienced Mathematica programmer should find it easy to extend 
the conversion algorithm to address these issues. 

Bug reports, comments, suggestions should be sent to

Installation and Use
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install the package place it into 

	~/.Mathematica/Applications/

in your home directory (or whatever corresponds to this location on 
your system).  After installation, do a "Rebuild Help Index" so that 
Mathematica updates its browser information.  A (currently rather tiny)
browser file should then be available under "Add-ons", see there for 
usage information.

To load the package type 

	Needs["nb2omdoc`nb2omdoc`"]


Note that NB2OMDoc[nb]  returns a potentially very large XML expression. 
It is usually best to supress output:

	res = NB2OMDoc["Sample"];

You can then check for errors like so:

	XML`SymbolicXMLErrors[res]
	snb =  Import["Sample.omdoc", "XML", 
		ConversionOptions -> {"ValidateAgainstDTD" -> True}]

For the sample notebook  Sample.nb  in the Example directory, there should
be no errors (assuming the DTD is in the right place).

In standard mode, NB2OMDoc works quietly, printing only two messages at 
the begin and end of conversion.  If you want to get more feedback, type

	SetVerbose[]

and 

	SetVerbose[False]

for a return to the default (no debugging information).
